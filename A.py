"""As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Python 3.12 had not been released, and specific features for that version were unknown. Python's development process involves several PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals) that are proposed, discussed, and accepted or rejected by the Python community. 

To get the most accurate and up-to-date information about new features and changes in Python 3.12, I recommend checking the official Python website (https://www.python.org/) or the Python Developer's Guide (https://devguide.python.org/).

You can also look for the release notes and PEPs associated with Python 3.12 to learn about any new features, improvements, or changes that have been introduced.
 Keep in mind that my information might be outdated, and new releases and changes may have occurred since then."""

""" Python 3.12 was published on October 2, 2023. As usual, the new version comes out in October after lots of effort by volunteers worldwide.

The new version comes with several new features and improvements that you’ll explore in this tutorial. You can also dive into the documentation to see a complete list of all changes.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn about new features and improvements, like:

Better error messages with helpful suggestions and guidance
More expressive f-strings that are backed by Python’s PEG parser
Optimizations, including inlined comprehensions, for a faster Python
A new syntax for type variables that you use to annotate generics
Support for the powerful perf profiler on Linux
If you want to try any of the examples in this tutorial, then you’ll need to use Python 3.12. The tutorials Python 3 Installation & Setup Guide and How Can You Install a Pre-Release Version of Python? walk you through several options for adding a new version of Python to your system.

In addition to learning more about the new features coming to the language, you’ll also get some advice about what to consider before upgrading to the new version.

"""Python enthusiasts, the wait is over — Python 3.12 is here, and it’s packed with updates that refine the coding experience. 
Let’s dive into the key highlights with some practical examples:
1:Enhanced f-strings: f-strings are now more flexible, allowing for multi-line expressions and comments.
# Before Python 3.12:
f"Result: {value}"  # Couldn't span multiple lines or include comments
# In Python 3.12:
f"""
Result: {
  value  # You can now include inline comments!
}
"""
2. Filesystem Improvements: The pathlib and os modules got a tune-up for better file handling.

# pathlib.Path now supports subclassing
class MyPath(pathlib.Path):
    # Custom methods can be added to extend functionality
    def read_as_upper(self):
        return self.read_text().upper()
